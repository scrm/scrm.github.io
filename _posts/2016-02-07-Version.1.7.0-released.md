It has been a while since scrm 1.6.1 was released. We finally released the new
version 1.7.0 today. It brings the '--transpose-segsites' command line flag
which prints the segregating sites with rows repesenting mutations instead
of individuals and contains some additional information about the mutations.

Full Changelog:

### New Features
+ New command line option "--transpose-segsites" that prints the segregating
  sites matrix with rows repesenting mutations instead of individuals. This
  also adds the time at which the mutation occurred as additional information
  (#85).

### Improvements
+ scrm now throws an error when mutation or recombination rate changes
  have invalid sequence positions (#82).
+ The length of segments between recombinations is now always reported
  in non-scientific notation (#81).
+ Improved the error message when lines could not coalescence because
  of missing migration or negative population growth (#87).

### Bug Fixes
+ `Forest.coalescence_finished` has not set to `true` after a pairwise
  coalescence event (#89). This had no effect on the command line version
  of scrm.
+ Fixes scrm's tests suite on 32 bit systems (#98).
