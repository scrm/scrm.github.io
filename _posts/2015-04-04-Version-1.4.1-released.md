We just published a bug fix release _1.4.1_. This fixes the first major
problem in _scrm_, where population sizes where incorrectly calculated when
changes of migration rates and/or population splits or merges occurred in
an ongoing exponential decline/growth of a population.
If you simulated such a model, please rerun the simulations with version _1.4.1_. 

We are sorry for any inconvenience caused.


Change Log:
-----------

+ Bug fix: Wrong population size where calculated when migration rates
  changes or population splits and merges occurred in a growth period (#56)
+ Added an error message when a population size is set to 0 (#52)
+ Bug fix: When -es was used at time 0, _scrm_ ran into an endless loop (#53)
