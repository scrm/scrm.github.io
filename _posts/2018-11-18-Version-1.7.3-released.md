We just published the bug-fix release 1.7.3. It primarily fixes
the execution of multiple population splits and merges happening
at the same time.

## Changelog

### Improvements
+ The labeling of internal nodes in the oriented forest output
  no longer changes within the same tree topology. That makes
  it easier to identify different topologies.

### Bug Fixes
+ Now requires that subpopulation are defined via the `-I` argument
  before any demographic options for all population (`-M`, `-G` or `-N`)
  are given (#108).
  Thanks to Jonathan Terhorst (@terhorst) for reporting this bug.
+ When the multiple of the merge/admixure arguemtns (`-ep`, `-eps` and `-ej`)
  are used at the time, they are now executed in order in which
  they are provided on the command line (#121). This behavior now
  follows ms' implementation. 
  Thanks to Scott T Small (@stsmall) for reporting this.
