We just published version 1.5.0 of _scrm_. It adds support for printing models
and a new command line flag "-eps" for partial admixture. It also fixes the 
resolving of multiple population splits and merges occurring at the same time:

+ New feature: Added flag "--print-model" which prints a textual representation
  of the demographic model for verification and debugging (#60). 
+ Bug fix: When multiple population splits and/or merges occurred at the same
  time, only one of them affected each line while the others were ignored (#61). 
+ New feature: Added support for partial population admixtures (`-eps`, #62).
+ In addition to using "-seed" scrm now also supports "-seeds", as ms also 
  supports both.
