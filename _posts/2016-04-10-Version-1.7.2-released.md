We just published another bug-fix update, version 1.7.2. The new version fixes
another problem related to the `-eI` option (#104). In previous version, _scrm_
could sometimes abort simulation using this option, and throw a number of
different error messages.


Full Changelog:

### Bug Fixes
+ Fixes a different bug that could occur when using the "-eI" option. The
contemporaries buffer was always cleared correctly between repetitions, and
could cause scrm to throw an error (#104). Thanks again to @jackkamm for
reporting this bug.
