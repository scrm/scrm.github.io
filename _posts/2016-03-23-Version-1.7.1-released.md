We released version 1.7.1 of _scrm_ today. The new version fixes bug #102 that
could occur when using non-contemporary samples ("-eI" option). In some circumstances, all
previous version of _scrm_ could jump over some time periods in that case. This
led to error messages in most case, but could sometimes also silently 
produce wrong results. 

We recommend to repeat all simulation that used the "-eI" option with the new 
version to make sure that they are not affected by this bug. 


Full Changelog:

### Bug Fixes
+ Fixes that bug that could lead to false results when the "-eI" option
  was used to include non-contemporary samples. In that case, scrm
  could skip the time interval between the MRCA of the contemporary samples
  and the time of the "-eI" event (if any), and neglect all events 
  during that time. We recommend to repeat all simulations which
  used "-eI" with the updated version (#102).
