I just published version 1.5.1, which fixes a bug that could lead to runs being
aborted with an error message:

+ Bug fix: Fixed a cache invalidation error that could lead to runs being
  aborted after 100k recombinations (#70). Thanks to Jerome Kelleher for 
  report this.
+ Minor: Small updates to the documentation and citation information.
