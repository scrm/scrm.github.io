Version 1.6.0 was released today. Changes:

### New Features
+ It is now possible to specify the approximation exact window in number 
  of recombination events (#73).
+ scrm now uses a conservative approximation by default (#75).

### Bug Fixes
+ Critical:  Position based rates changes (`-sr` and `-st`) were only
  applied to the first locus. If `nrep` was greater than one, all other loci 
  were simulated with the rates from the end of the first one (#74). 
  All simulations done with previous versions that used `-sr` or `-st` 
  together with `nrep` greater than one should be repeated. 
+ In large models, the Newick trees can get larger than the character limit
  of a C++ string. In this cases, only incomplete trees were printed (#76).
