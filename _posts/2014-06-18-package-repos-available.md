There are now scrm package repositories available for the current version of Debian,
Fedora, openSUSE and Ubuntu Linux:

[http://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=home%3Apaulst&package=scrm](http://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=home%3Apaulst&package=scrm)

I'm planing to add an package to the arch user repositories soon.
