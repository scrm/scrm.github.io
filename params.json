Scrm does not support\r\nsimulating a fixed number of segregating sites (ms' \"-s\") and gene conversions\r\n(\"-c\"). \r\n\r\nAdditionally, scrm has an option that ms does not have. Use \"-l\" followed by an\r\nnon-negative integer to give the length of an \"exact window\". This is the\r\nsequence part that scrm will simulate according to the full Ancestral\r\nRecombination Graph. Lines of more sequence positions further away will be\r\nignored to speedup the simulation process. \r\n\r\n## Licence\r\nYou can freely use all code in this project under the conditions of the GNU\r\nGPL Version 3 or later.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
